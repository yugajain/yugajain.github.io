It’s an exciting time to be an Android user, especially if you own a Pixel. New priority notifications, media playback controls, messaging app bubbles, and many more features were announced for Android 11 Beta 1.

                But! Before you go installing Android 11 on your main smartphone, keep in mind that this is a beta. It’s not meant to be the most stable version of Android ever made. In fact, we’ve found a handful of bugs in this build that may stop you from installing it on your Pixel device. Here’s what we’ve found out about Android 11 performance so far, as well as some of our thoughts on the new Android 11 features.
            
                This is a bit of a unique Android 11 build. Usually, the first beta is where Google rolls out new UI changes (if there are any) or any other new user-facing features. We’re not getting a lot of that here. Google has trickled out feature after feature in the first four developer previews, and many of the things that weren’t already official leaked out weeks in advance.

                What I’m saying is, there aren’t a lot of surprises here, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a lot to dig into. We’ve rounded up all the new and notable Android 11 features right here, so be sure to check that out for more granular developer-focused features. In Android 11 Beta 1, there are a handful of really useful tweaks that make Android feel much more mature. <br>
